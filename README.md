# Project: Recipes
## Introduction
This is the first assignment for the HTML Foundation Course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Part of this assignment was to create a Recipes Website using the course material in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/).

Some of the skills I have learned include but are not limited to:
- Working with **Headings** and **Paragraphs**
- Using ordered and unordered **Lists**
- Embedding **Links** and **Images** (and learning about the importance of adding alternative text for visually impaired people)
- Understanding the **Unix File Structure** 
- Getting familiar with **git** and the **Command line**

A first preview of the unpolished HTML Website can be seen [here](https://resner.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html).

> Note to self: I got very hungry while writing down the recipes :-)

## Future
I'm looking forward to learning CSS and Javascript and using what I learn to make the website more engaging and responsive.
