# Project: Recipes
## Introduction
This is the first assignment for the HTML Foundation Course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Part of this assignment was to create a Recipes Website using the course material in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/).

Some of the skills I have learned include but are not limited to:
- Working with **Headings** and **Paragraphs**
- Using ordered and unordered **Lists**
- Embedding **Links** and **Images** (and learning about the importance of adding alternative text for visually impaired people)
- Understanding the **Unix File Structure** 
- Getting familiar with **git** and the **Command line**

A preview of the Website can be found [here](https://resner.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html).

> Note to self: I got very hungry while writing down the recipes :-)

## Future
~~I'm looking forward to learning CSS and Javascript~~ and using what I learn to make the website more engaging and responsive.

### Update February 16th, 2023
As a follow-up to the course, I applied some simple CSS rules to the site.
This was my first project and it's not exactly a masterpiece, so bear with me while I try to ~~solve world hunger~~ get more proficient with CSS.

I advice you to check out some of my more recent repositories where I delve into interesting concepts like **Flexbox** and **Grids** :)
